# Task Management App - Single-Page Application

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements and specifications for building a Task Management App, which will be a single-page application (SPA). The app will enable users to perform basic task management operations, such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks. React.js will be utilized for the frontend development, while the backend will be implemented using Node.js.

## Features

The Task Management App will have the following features:

1. **Add**: Users can add new tasks by providing a task title, description, and optionally, a due date.

2. **Read**: Users can view a list of all the tasks they have added. The tasks will be displayed with their title, description, and due date (if provided).

3. **Update**: Users can edit existing tasks, modifying their title, description, and due date.

4. **Delete**: Users can remove tasks from the task list.

## Technology Stack

The technology stack for building the Task Management App includes:

- Frontend: React.js - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- Backend: Node.js - A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server.

- Database: For simplicity, this document will assume the use of a basic JSON file or an in-memory data store to persist task data. However, in a real-world application, a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL would be preferred.

## Frontend Implementation

The frontend will be built using React.js. It will consist of the following components:

1. **TaskForm**: A form component to add and update tasks.

2. **TaskList**: A component to display the list of tasks.

3. **TaskItem**: A component to represent an individual task in the list.

## Backend Implementation

The backend will be developed using Node.js. It will include the following routes:

1. **GET /tasks**: Fetches all tasks from the backend and returns them as JSON.

2. **POST /tasks**: Adds a new task to the backend.

3. **PUT /tasks/:taskId**: Updates an existing task identified by its ID.

4. **DELETE /tasks/:taskId**: Deletes a task with the specified ID.

## Data Model

The task data model will consist of the following properties:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each task (e.g., generated using UUID).

- `title`: The title of the task.

- `description`: A brief description of the task.

- `dueDate`: An optional due date for the task.

## Deployment

The Task Management App can be deployed on a hosting platform like Heroku or Netlify for the frontend, and a service like AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean for the backend.

## Conclusion

The Task Management App will provide users with a simple and intuitive interface to manage their tasks effectively. By leveraging the power of React.js on the frontend and Node.js on the backend, the app will be capable of handling the core task management functionalities. Additionally, with further enhancements and the integration of a robust database, the app can scale to accommodate larger task lists and meet real-world demands.
